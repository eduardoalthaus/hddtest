# INFO  
It is well-known that the biggest culprit for the delay of loading files and programs is the HDD, an old piece that is almost falling into disuse due to the high adoption of SSD's at speeds up to 20x faster than an HDD.  

What most people do not know is that the hardware also suffers wear and tear over time. The HDD, for containing moving parts and recording everything using electromagnetism, is doomed to break at some point and that is why there are programs to read the disc's life.  

HDD with any defect, "bad sectors" or any physical damage, will leave the user's computer much slower than usual, sometimes causing even crashes or random errors where the user will think that only need to format to get back to good. What a big mistake, HDD problem is only solved by replacing it.  

Use this utility to check the condition of your HDD, any result that is not equal to 100%, be aware that you need to replace your disk ASAP.
